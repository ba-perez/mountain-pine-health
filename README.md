# mountain-pine-health
All scripts related to the project on mountain pine health by Barbara M. P. B. de Araujo (TUM / Berchtesgaden National Park)

## First things first
- Are all files up to date? <br />
    Either update them or add a to-do below <br />
    Then continue working <br />

## To do
- Describe randomiser scripts (Python and R)
- Maybe improve R script (but I don't think so lol)
- Add other relevant scripts and complete their R/Python counterparts
